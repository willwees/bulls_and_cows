## About the Game

Bulls and Cows is a classic number guessing game where players try to guess a secret number within a limited number of attempts. In this implementation:

- The computer generates a random number between 1 and 10
- Players have up to 10 attempts to guess the correct number
- After each guess, the game provides hints:
  - "Too small!" if your guess is lower than the secret number
  - "Too big!" if your guess is higher than the secret number
  - "Congratulation you're right!" when you guess correctly
- After 5 attempts, the game shows how many tries you've made
- If you don't guess within 10 attempts, the game ends

## Features

- Random number generation using the `rand` crate
- Input validation (ensures numbers are between 1-10)
- Error handling for invalid input
- Attempt counter with hints
- Maximum attempt limit

## Prerequisites

- [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) (latest stable version)
- Cargo (comes with Rust)

## Installation & Running

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>

## How to Play

1. Run the game using `cargo run`
2. When prompted, enter a number between 1 and 10
